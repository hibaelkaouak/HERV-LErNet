# HERV-LErNet
## Overview
HERV-LErNet is an extension of the LErNet framework, it will be adapted for analyzing the interaction between Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) and genes through 3D genomic structures such as Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops.

## Features (to be updated)
- Identifies HERVs located within TADs and their co-localized genes
- Analyzes HERVs involved in chromatin loop anchors and their potential gene targets
- Visualizes HERV-gene relationships through interactive network graphs
- Supports both TAD-based and loop-based connectivity analysis

## Requirements
- R (>= 4.0.0)
- Bioconductor packages:
	- GenomicRanges
	- rtracklayer
	- GenomeInfoDb

- CRAN packages:
	- dplyr
	- visNetwork

## Internship Project
This code is being developed as part of an internship project extending the functionality of LErNet for HERV-specific analysis.
